# Monday
- What did you achieve over the weekend?
    * Over the weekend, I was able to come up with an idea of what I want my project to be. Afterwards, I was able to ping the API that I planned on using to see if I was able to get the data back. Other than that, not much else.
- What are your goals for today?
    * I plan on finishing up the proposal with all the information required on my project. Further, 
- Do you have any blockers?
    * Not at the moment. 


# Tuesday
- What did you achieve over Monday?
    * I was able to create some routes and display the data that I pulled from the API. 
- What are your goals for today?
    * I plan on building more routes and building some of the models association from one group to another.
- Do you have any blockers?
    * Not at the moment, but I anticipate some of the associations to be a blocker that I'll run into when I start linking the models.
